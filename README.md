## My Portfolio

Tools that I made use of:
SASS, AJAX and Vue.js

In Laravel v8 i have used laravel jetstream and fortify for generating authentication scaffolding and laravel roles and permission management system for making a super admin in the site.

Then i have used laravel blueprint shift for generating Views Models And Controllers for creating the Project upload and management system and same for generating site CRUDs for the website colours logo text copy and SEO metadata

(I found easy doing like this because I have a base in it, thats why I went out of the way and made use of this)


## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
