#My Portfolio

Tools that I made use of:
SASS, AJAX and Vue.js

In Laravel v8 i have used laravel jetstream and fortify for generating authentication scaffolding and laravel roles and permission management system for making a super admin in the site
then i have used laravel blueprint shift for generating Views Models And Controllers for creating the Project upload and management system and same for generating site CRUDs for the website colours logo text copy and SEO metadata 
(I found easy doing like this because I have a base in it, thats why I went out of the way and made use of this)
